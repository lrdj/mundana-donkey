Mesothelioma is an evil fucking thing. It just cut a notch for Air Vice Marshall Rear Admiral Sir Michael Bland and leaves Charlotte, Natalie and Christine without father and husband:-(

I wanted to share this video from Boxing Day 2006. My notes from the original post:

> So how did I get talked into this one;-) Family friends Christine and Michael Bland 
> spend a large part of the year catering fabulous affairs on the pebbles of Budleigh beach 
> (100 yards South of the nudist beach, near the gentlemen’s club…). 
> This is the first year that the Dug and Nicki branch of our little family managed 
> to get our shit together to get out on the beach (Jed and Billy actually swam 
> in the same freezing waters just yesterday) and I was way impressed: 
> hot food, hot wine and a functioning Victrola!

Michael brought his own brand of craziness to the world (and if you're wondering, everyone in the vid is a fierce Remainer). I thought this captured some of the Michael spirit and wanted to share it with friends. The world is considerably more ordinary now that he has left.

Godspeed.
